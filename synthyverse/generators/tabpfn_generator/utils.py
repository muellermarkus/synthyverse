    """Warn if a TabPFN model isn't configured to use the KV cache.

    The KV cache (improved with TabPFN-3) caches the encoder pass over the training set so that
    repeated predicts against the same fitted model don't re-encode the
    training data each time. Extensions that issue many predicts per fit
    (e.g. imputation-based SHAP, certain feature-selection or HPO routines)
    benefit from it — without the cache, the encoder pass over the training
    set runs on every predict and these extensions can be 10-100x slower
    than necessary.

    What has to hold depends on the backend. An endpoint-backed estimator
    (self-hosted container, SageMaker, Foundry) needs ``use_kv_cache=True``,
    which is the only condition. A local model needs both:
        1. ``model`` was constructed with ``fit_mode="fit_with_cache"``
           (a constructor argument, must be set BEFORE ``.fit()``).
        2. ``model.executor_.keep_cache_on_device`` is ``True`` (set AFTER
           ``.fit()``; usually the default but worth setting explicitly).

    This helper warns if either is missing, but does not raise — users may
    have intentional reasons (e.g. memory).

    Args:

       unique values, with more than ``MIN_SAMPLES_PER_CATEGORY`` samples per
       unique value on average, to avoid mislabelling columns that only look
       low-cardinality because the sample is too thin per level.

    Parameters:
        X (np.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame): The input data.

            feature indices. If None, will start with an empty list.
